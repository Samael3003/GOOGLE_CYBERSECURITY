# Architecture of Linux

## Overview

- **Introduction to Operating System Architecture**
  - Similar to buildings, operating systems have architectural components that work together.

## Components of Linux

- **1. User**
  - Initiates tasks and commands within the system.
  - Linux supports multiple users simultaneously.

- **2. Applications**
  - Programs designed for specific tasks (e.g., word processors, calculators).
  - Distributed via package managers like Nano for text editing.

- **3. Shell**
  - Command Line Interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
  - Interprets commands and outputs results.

- **4. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**
  - Organizes data like a filing cabinet.
  - Defines how data is stored and accessed within the system.

- **5. Kernel**
  - Manages processes and memory.
  - Communicates with hardware to execute commands.
  - Optimizes resource allocation for improved system performance.

- **6. Hardware**
  - Physical components of the computer.
  - Includes CPU, mouse, keyboard, etc.

## Conclusion

Understanding the architecture of Linux is crucial for navigating its functionalities and optimizing its use in various applications, including security and system administration.
