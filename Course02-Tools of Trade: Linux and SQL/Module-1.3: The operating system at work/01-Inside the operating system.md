# How Operating Systems Work

## Overview

In this video, we explore how operating systems (OS) facilitate computer tasks, from booting up to executing applications, and their relevance to security analysis.

## Key Points

### Booting Process

- **BIOS/UEFI:**
  - BIOS or UEFI initiates booting by activating bootloader
  - Bootloader starts the OS, essential for system startup

- **Security Considerations:**
  - BIOS often not scanned by antivirus, vulnerable to malware
  - Understanding booting process crucial for security analysts

### User Interaction

- **Applications:**
  - Programs used to perform specific tasks
  - OS interprets user requests and manages hardware interaction

- **Hardware Interaction:**
  - OS directs requests to appropriate hardware components (e.g., CPU)
  - Hardware sends data back to OS, which is relayed to applications

### Example: Using a Calculator

- **Process Overview:**
  - User clicks calculator application
  - OS directs user input (calculations) to CPU
  - CPU computes results, sends back to OS
  - OS displays result in calculator application

### Security Analysis

- **Event Investigation:**
  - Security analysts trace system interactions to identify security events
  - Understanding OS processes aids in pinpointing security vulnerabilities

### Importance for Security Analysts

- **Knowledge Base:**
  - Analogous to mechanics understanding cars, analysts need OS understanding
  - Essential for diagnosing and resolving security issues effectively
