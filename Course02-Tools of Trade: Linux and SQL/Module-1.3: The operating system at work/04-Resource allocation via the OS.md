## Orchestra Analogy

- **Role of OS:**
  - OS acts as the conductor in an orchestra, managing resource allocation.
  - Balances CPU, memory, storage, and bandwidth allocation among various programs and tasks.
  - Ensures efficient use of limited system capacity.

## Task Manager Insight

- **Visibility for Analysts:**
  - Task Manager displays active tasks, memory usage, and CPU usage.
  - Provides insights into resource allocation and program performance.
  
## Analyst's Perspective

- **Analytical Use:**
  - Helps analysts identify resource-intensive tasks or anomalies.
  - Useful for troubleshooting slow system performance or detecting malware.
  - Fundamental understanding of OS operations enhances security analysis skills.
