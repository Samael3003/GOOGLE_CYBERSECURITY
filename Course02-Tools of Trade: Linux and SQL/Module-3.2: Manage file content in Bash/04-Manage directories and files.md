# Lecture Notes: Managing Directories and Files in Linux

## Overview

Previously, you explored how to manage the file system using Linux commands. The following commands were introduced: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, and `cp`. In this reading, you’ll review these commands, the `nano` text editor, and learn another way to write to files.

## Creating and Modifying Directories

### `mkdir` Command

The `mkdir` command creates a new directory. You can provide the new directory as an absolute file path, starting from the root, or as a relative file path, starting from your current directory.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  mkdir directory_name
  ```
- **Examples**:
  ```sh
  mkdir /home/analyst/logs/network   # Absolute path
  mkdir network                     # Relative path (if in /home/analyst/logs)
  ```
  - **Pro Tip**: Use the `ls` command to confirm the new directory was added.

### `rmdir` Command

The `rmdir` command removes an empty directory.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  rmdir directory_name
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  rmdir /home/analyst/logs/network
  ```
  - **Note**: The `rmdir` command cannot delete directories with files or subdirectories inside.

## Creating and Modifying Files

### `touch` Command

The `touch` command creates a new, empty file.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  touch file_name
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  touch permissions.txt
  ```

### `rm` Command

The `rm` command removes a file. Use this command carefully, as deleted files are difficult to recover.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  rm file_name
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  rm permissions.txt
  ```
  - **Pro Tip**: Use the `ls` command to confirm the file was successfully created or removed.

## Moving and Copying Files or Directories

### `mv` Command

The `mv` command moves a file or directory to a new location. It can also be used to rename files.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  mv source destination
  ```
- **Examples**:
  ```sh
  mv permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs      # Moving a file
  mv permissions.txt perm.txt                # Renaming a file
  ```

### `cp` Command

The `cp` command copies a file or directory to a new location.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sh
  cp source destination
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```sh
  cp permissions.txt /home/analyst/logs
  ```

## `nano` Text Editor

The `nano` command-line file editor is available by default in many Linux distributions and is widely used in the security profession. You can perform multiple basic tasks in `nano`, such as creating new files and modifying file contents.

### Opening and Creating Files in `nano`

- **Opening an Existing File**:
  ```sh
  nano file_name
  ```
  - **Example**:
    ```sh
    nano permissions.txt
    ```

- **Creating a New File**:
  ```sh
  nano new_file_name
  ```
  - **Example**:
    ```sh
    nano authorized_users.txt
    ```

### Saving and Exiting `nano`

- **Saving**: Press `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`.
- **Exiting**: Press `Ctrl + X`.

## Standard Output Redirection

### Using `echo` with `>` and `>>`

In addition to piping (`|`), you can use the right angle bracket (`>`) and double right angle bracket (`>>`) operators to redirect standard output.

- **`>`**: Overwrites the existing file.
- **`>>`**: Appends to the end of the existing file.

### Examples

- **Appending to a File**:
  ```sh
  echo "last updated date" >> permissions.txt
  ```
- **Overwriting a File**:
  ```sh
  echo "time" > permissions.txt
  ```

  - **Note**: Both the `>` and `>>` operators will create a new file if one doesn’t already exist with your specified name.

## Key Takeaways

Knowing how to manage the file system in Linux is an important skill for security analysts. Useful commands for this include: `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, and `cp`.
