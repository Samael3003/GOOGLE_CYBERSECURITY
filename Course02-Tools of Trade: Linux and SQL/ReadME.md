# Overview
This repository contains detailed notes and resources about operating systems, their primary functions, and how they facilitate interaction between hardware, software, and users. The content is designed to help learners understand the fundamental concepts and practical applications of operating systems.

# Course Description
In this course, you will explore the relationship between operating systems, hardware, and software. You will become familiar with the primary functions of an operating system, recognize common operating systems in use today, and understand how the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) allow users to interact with the operating system.
