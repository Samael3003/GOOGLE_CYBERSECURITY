## Transcript Summary

### Introduction

> Hi, I'm Kim. I'm a technical program manager at Google. I'm currently working in the security, mergers, and acquisitions team. Where I work with other companies that we purchase, and I help them integrate into the Google environment. 

### Career Journey

Kim's career path into cybersecurity was unconventional:
- **Previous Roles:** 
  - Restaurant worker
  - English tutor for international students
- **Transition to Technology:** 
  - Completed multiple internships
  - Graduated from university
  - First opportunity in technology led to an interest in cybersecurity

### Encouragement for Aspiring Cybersecurity Professionals

> I want to tell everyone with any type of background that you can get into cybersecurity. If you're interested in protecting information, if you're interested in protecting people in the future, security is there for you.

- **Diverse Roles:** There are many different roles within cybersecurity.
- **Transferable Skills:** Existing skills from previous experiences can be valuable in security roles.

### Essential Skills in Cybersecurity

> The skill that I use the most is connecting with people every day. I can't get anything done unless I connect with them the right way. So that's actually the biggest skill I lean on the most working in security.

- **Interpersonal Skills:** Effective communication and connecting with people are crucial in cybersecurity.

### Advice for Newcomers

> A piece of advice I would give for someone new starting in the cybersecurity field is to keep an open mind. I started out with a degree in business, so I didn't even feel like I was technical enough to be where I am today. And before that, all of my experiences were either restaurant work, or marketing work, or just something that felt like it was unrelated to technology. But all of that helped me and motivated me to actually kind of get my feet more wet into technology, and then eventually security.

- **Keep an Open Mind:** Stay open to learning and new opportunities.
- **Value All Experiences:** Previous experiences, even if seemingly unrelated, can provide valuable skills and perspectives.
- **Overcoming Self-Doubt:** With support from peers and respect from colleagues, self-doubt can be replaced with confidence.
