# Lecture Notes: Different Types of Shells

## Introduction to Shells

### Overview

Understanding how to work with Linux shells is an essential skill for cybersecurity professionals. Shells are used for various tasks, providing a command-line interface for interacting with the computer system.

### Communicating through a Shell

- **Shell as a Translator**: The shell acts as a translator between the user and the computer system, allowing users to give commands and receive responses.
- **Command Execution**: When a command is entered into a shell, it interprets the command, sends it to the kernel, and returns the results.

## Types of Shells

There are several types of Linux shells, each with unique features but common basic commands:

1. **Bourne-Again Shell (bash)**
2. **C Shell (csh)**
3. **Korn Shell (ksh)**
4. **Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)**
5. **Z Shell (zsh)**

### Differences Among Shells

- **Command Prompt Indicators**:
  - `bash` and `ksh` use the dollar sign ($) to indicate where users type commands.
  - `zsh` uses the percent sign (%) for the command prompt.
- **Common Commands**: All shells use common Linux commands but may have different features and syntax for advanced functionalities.

### Bash Shell

- **Default Shell**: Bash is the default shell in most Linux distributions.
- **User-Friendly**: Known for its ease of use and suitability for both basic commands and larger projects.
- **Popularity**: Bash is the most popular shell in the cybersecurity profession and is used throughout this course for learning and practicing Linux commands.

## Key Takeaways

- Shells are a fundamental part of the Linux operating system, acting as translators between the user and the computer system.
- There are various types of shells, each with unique features.
- The bash shell is the most commonly used shell in the cybersecurity field and is the focus of this course.

By familiarizing yourself with different types of shells, particularly bash, you will be better equipped to interact with the Linux operating system effectively.
