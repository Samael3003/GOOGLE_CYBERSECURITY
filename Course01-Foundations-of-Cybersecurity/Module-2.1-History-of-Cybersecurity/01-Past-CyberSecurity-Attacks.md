# Evolution of Security Threats and Attacks

## Introduction
The security industry continuously evolves, with many modern attacks building upon earlier methods. Understanding historical attacks is crucial for security analysts to effectively handle and investigate incidents.

## Key Terms
- **Computer Virus**: Malicious code that interferes with computer operations and damages data and software by attaching itself to programs or documents.
- **Malware**: Generic term for software designed to harm devices or networks, encompassing viruses and other malicious software.

### Brain Virus (1986)
- **Description**: Created to track illegal copies of medical software but unintentionally spread globally via infected disks.
- **Impact**: Slowed productivity and disrupted business operations, highlighting the need for robust security measures.

### Morris Worm (1988)
- **Description**: Developed by Robert Morris to assess the size of the internet; inadvertently caused widespread damage by overloading systems.
- **Impact**: Affected 6,000 computers (10% of the internet at the time), leading to significant financial losses and establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs®).

## Security Industry Impact
- **Brain Virus**: Emphasized the necessity of security planning to protect data and ensure business continuity.
- **Morris Worm**: Led to the establishment of CERTs® to respond to and manage computer security incidents, evolving to encompass broader security responsibilities.

## Conclusion
Early malware attacks such as the Brain virus and Morris worm played pivotal roles in shaping today's security industry. Understanding these historical incidents equips security analysts with insights into evolving threats and effective incident response strategies.
