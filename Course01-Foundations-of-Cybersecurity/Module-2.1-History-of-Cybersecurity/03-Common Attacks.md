# Common Cybersecurity Attacks and Social Engineering

## Phishing
- **Definition**: Use of digital communications to trick individuals into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
- **Types**:
  - **Business Email Compromise (BEC)**: Email from a seemingly known source requesting sensitive information for financial gain.
  - **Spear Phishing**: Targeted malicious emails appearing to originate from trusted sources.
  - **Whaling**: Spear phishing targeting high-profile executives for access to sensitive data.
  - **Vishing**: Exploitation of voice communication to gather sensitive information or impersonate known sources.
  - **Smishing**: Use of text messages to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.

## Malware
- **Definition**: Software designed to harm devices or networks, often for financial or intelligence gains.
- **Types**:
  - **Viruses**: Requires user initiation, spreads through infected attachments or downloads.
  - **Worms**: Self-replicating malware spreading across networks independently.
  - **Ransomware**: Encrypts data and demands payment for decryption.
  - **Spyware**: Collects and sells personal information without consent.

## Social Engineering
- **Definition**: Manipulation technique exploiting human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
- **Types**:
  - **Social Media Phishing**: Gathering target information from social media for targeted attacks.
  - **Watering Hole Attack**: Targeting a website frequented by a specific group of users.
  - **USB Baiting**: Leaving a malware-infected USB for unsuspecting users to plug into their systems.
  - **Physical Social Engineering**: Impersonating trusted individuals to gain physical access.

### Principles of Social Engineering
- **Effectiveness**: Relies on exploiting human trust and behavior.
- **Reasons for Effectiveness**:
  - **Authority**: Exploiting trust in authority figures.
  - **Intimidation**: Using fear or bullying tactics.
  - **Consensus/Social Proof**: Exploiting trust in what others are doing.
  - **Scarcity**: Creating urgency by implying limited availability.
  - **Familiarity**: Creating a false emotional connection.
  - **Trust**: Building a relationship over time to gain information.
  - **Urgency**: Pressuring quick responses without questioning.

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding common attack methods and social engineering tactics is crucial for identifying and defending against cybersecurity threats.
- Continued learning and practice throughout the program will enhance skills in threat detection and mitigation.
