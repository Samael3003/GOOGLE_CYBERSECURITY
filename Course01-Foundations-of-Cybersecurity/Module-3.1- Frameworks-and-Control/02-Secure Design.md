# Security Frameworks and Controls

## Introduction
We discussed frameworks and controls in general. In this section, you'll learn about specific frameworks and controls that organizations can voluntarily use to minimize risks to their data and protect users.

## The CIA Triad
The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. CIA stands for:

1. **Confidentiality**: Ensures that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. This involves implementing strict access controls to keep confidential data safe.
2. **Integrity**: Ensures data is correct, authentic, and reliable. Data protection methods like encryption are used to safeguard data from tampering.
3. **Availability**: Ensures data is accessible to those authorized to access it.

## Key Term: Asset
An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization, with its value determined by the associated cost. For example, an application storing sensitive data is a valuable asset requiring tighter security controls than a website sharing public news content.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. It serves as a baseline for security teams to manage short and long-term risks, with the key goals of mitigating risks and protecting an organization's assets from threat actors.

### Understanding Threat Actors
- **Disgruntled Employees**: Often have access to sensitive information and know where to find it, making them particularly dangerous.
- **Global Threat Actors**: A diverse workforce of security professionals can help identify attackers' intentions and mitigate malicious activities.

## Conclusion
The CIA triad and NIST CSF framework are essential for developing processes to secure organizations and protect the people they serve. Understanding these frameworks and principles is crucial for security professionals and can be a key topic in job interviews. Throughout this program, you'll have multiple opportunities to learn more about these frameworks and apply them to real-world situations.
