# Understanding Security Frameworks and Controls

## Introduction
Imagine you're working as a security analyst and receive multiple alerts about suspicious activity on the network. You'll need to implement additional security measures to prevent these alerts from becoming serious incidents. But where do you start?

## Identifying Critical Assets and Risks
As an analyst, you'll start by identifying your organization's critical assets and risks. Then you'll implement the necessary frameworks and controls.

## Security Frameworks
### Definition
Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle, which is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance or laws.

### Purpose
The purpose of security frameworks includes:
- Protecting personally identifiable information (PII)
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organizational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

## Core Components of Security Frameworks
Frameworks have four core components, essential for managing potential risks:

1. **Identifying and Documenting Security Goals**
   - Example: Aligning with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) to ensure compliance.
   
2. **Setting Guidelines to Achieve Security Goals**
   - Example: Developing new policies for handling data requests to comply with GDPR.

3. **Implementing Strong Security Processes**
   - Example: Designing procedures to comply with user data requests under GDPR, such as updating or deleting profile information.

4. **Monitoring and Communicating Results**
   - Example: Monitoring internal networks and reporting potential security issues affecting GDPR compliance to a manager or regulatory compliance officer.

## Tying It All Together
Frameworks enable analysts to work with security team members to document, implement, and use the created policies and procedures. Understanding this process is crucial for entry-level analysts as it directly affects their work and collaboration with others.

## Security Controls
### Definition
Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

### Example
A company guideline may require all employees to complete privacy training to reduce data breach risks. As a security analyst, you may use software to assign and track training completion.

## Importance
Security frameworks and controls are vital for managing security in all types of organizations, ensuring that everyone maintains a low level of risk. Understanding their purpose and usage allows analysts to support an organization's security goals and protect the people it serves.

## Conclusion
In subsequent sections, we'll discuss well-known frameworks and principles that analysts need to minimize risk and protect data and users.
