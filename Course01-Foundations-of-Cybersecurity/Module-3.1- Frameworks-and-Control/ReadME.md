### Understandings on Security Frameworks, Secure Design, and Control Framework Compliance

---

#### Security Frameworks
- **Purpose**: Provide structured approaches to implementing security lifecycles.
- **Components**: Include identifying security goals, setting guidelines, implementing processes, and monitoring results.
- **Examples**: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF), CIS Controls, ISO standards.

#### Secure Design Principles
- **Focus**: Design systems and applications with security in mind from the outset.
- **Principles**: Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of data.
- **Methods**: Use encryption, access controls, and secure coding practices.

#### Control Framework Compliance
- **Definition**: Controls are safeguards to mitigate specific risks; frameworks provide guidelines for their implementation.
- **Importance**: Helps organizations align with regulatory requirements and reduce security risks.
- **Examples**: PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP.

#### Insights from Heather's Notes
- **PII Handling**: Deliberate handling and storage crucial; compliance with regulations necessary.
- **Consequences**: Non-compliance leads to legal actions, customer inquiries, and regulatory scrutiny.
- **Recommendations**: Regularly update compliance knowledge from relevant government sources; seek legal advice for jurisdiction-specific requirements.
