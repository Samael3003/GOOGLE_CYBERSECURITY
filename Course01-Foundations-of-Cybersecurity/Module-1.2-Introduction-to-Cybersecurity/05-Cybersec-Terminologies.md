# Common Cybersecurity Terminology

## Introduction
Cybersecurity (also known as security) is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation. This guide introduces key terms and concepts used in the cybersecurity profession.

## Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts

### Compliance
- **Definition**: Adhering to internal standards and external regulations to avoid fines and security breaches.

### Security Frameworks
- **Definition**: Guidelines used for building plans to mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

### Security Controls
- **Definition**: Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks, used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

### Security Posture
- **Definition**: An organizationâ€™s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

### Threat Actor (Malicious Attacker)
- **Definition**: Any person or group who presents a security risk, including risks to computers, applications, networks, and data.

### Internal Threat
- **Definition**: A current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk. Internal threats can be accidental (e.g., clicking on a malicious email link) or intentional (e.g., unauthorized data access).

### Network Security
- **Definition**: The practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access, including data, services, systems, and devices within the network.

### Cloud Security
- **Definition**: Ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access is limited to authorized users. Cloud security focuses on protecting data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

### Programming
- **Definition**: The process of creating a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Tasks can include automation of repetitive tasks, reviewing web traffic, and alerting suspicious activity.
