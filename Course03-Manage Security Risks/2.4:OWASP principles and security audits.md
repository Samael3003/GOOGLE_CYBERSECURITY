# OWASP Security Principles

1. **Minimize Attack Surface Area**:
   - Definition: Refers to all potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat actors.
   - Example Attack Vectors: Phishing emails, weak passwords.
   - Mitigation Strategies:
     - Disable unnecessary software features.
     - Restrict access to sensitive assets.
     - Implement complex password policies.

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Definition: Users should have the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
   - Purpose: Reduces potential damage from security breaches.
   - Example: An entry-level analyst may access log data but not change user permissions, limiting exposure in case of credential compromise.

3. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Definition: Employ multiple layers of security controls to mitigate risks.
   - Example Controls:
     - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
     - Firewalls.
     - Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

4. **Separation of Duties**:
   - Definition: Critical tasks should be divided among multiple individuals to prevent fraud or misuse.
   - Example: The person who prepares paychecks should not also be the one who signs them.

5. **Keep Security Simple**:
   - Definition: Avoid overly complex security solutions that can become unmanageable.
   - Importance: Simplicity facilitates collaboration and enhances security efficacy.

6. **Fix Security Issues Correctly**:
   - Definition: Quickly identify root causes of security incidents and implement effective fixes.
   - Example: If a weak Wi-Fi password is identified, stricter password policies should be enforced.

### Additional OWASP Principles

7. **Establish Secure Defaults**:
   - Definition: Applications should default to a secure state, making insecure configurations more difficult.

8. **Fail Securely**:
   - Definition: In the event of a failure, systems should default to their most secure state (e.g., a failing firewall should block all connections).

9. **Don’t Trust Services**:
   - Definition: Treat third-party services with caution; ensure their security measures align with the organization’s standards.

10. **Avoid Security by Obscurity**:
    - Definition: Security should not depend on keeping systems' details hidden. Robust security practices should encompass strong policies and controls.

### Security Audits

- **Definition**: A systematic review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against established criteria.
  
- **Types**: 
  - **External Audits**: Conducted by independent entities.
  - **Internal Audits**: Typically performed by the organization’s compliance officer and security team.

- **Purpose**: 
  - Improve security posture.
  - Identify risks and compliance issues.

#### Common Elements of Internal Security Audits

1. **Establishing Scope and Goals**:
   - Define criteria and objectives for the audit, identifying relevant assets, policies, and procedures.

2. **Conducting Risk Assessment**:
   - Identify potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to inform necessary security measures.

3. **Completing Controls Assessment**:
   - Review existing controls and classify them into:
     - **Administrative Controls**: Policies and procedures (e.g., password policies).
     - **Technical Controls**: Hardware and software measures (e.g., IDS, encryption).
     - **Physical Controls**: Security measures against physical access (e.g., locks, surveillance).

4. **Assessing Compliance**:
   - Ensure adherence to necessary regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

5. **Communicating Results**:
   - Summarize findings, existing risks, compliance needs, and recommendations for improving security posture.

### Key Takeaways

- Security principles guide daily cybersecurity practices and help minimize risks.
- Internal audits are essential for identifying gaps in security and ensuring compliance with regulations.
- Using established frameworks (e.g., NIST CSF) aids in preparing for audits and enhancing security measures.
