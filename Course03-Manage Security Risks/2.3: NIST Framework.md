# NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

#### Purpose of Frameworks
- Frameworks serve as starting points for organizations to develop plans that mitigate risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to sensitive data and assets.
- NIST provides valuable frameworks for security professionals globally, applicable to various types of organizations including for-profit, non-profit, and government entities.

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Overview
- The NIST CSF is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices aimed at managing cybersecurity risk.
- It comprises five core functions:
  1. Identify
  2. Protect
  3. Detect
  4. Respond
  5. Recover

### Core Functions of the NIST CSF

1. **Identify**
   - Involves managing cybersecurity risk and understanding its impact on people and assets within the organization.
   - Activities include monitoring systems and devices within the internal network to pinpoint potential security issues.

2. **Protect**
   - Focuses on implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate cybersecurity threats.
   - Analysts should study historical data to enhance policies and prepare for new and emerging threats.

3. **Detect**
   - Entails identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to enhance detection speed and efficiency.
   - Security analysts may review new security tool setups to ensure they effectively flag risks and alert teams about potential threats.

4. **Respond**
   - Involves following proper procedures to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents.
   - Analysts may document incidents and recommend process improvements to prevent recurrence.

5. **Recover**
   - Pertains to restoring affected systems to normal operation post-incident.
   - Security teams may work together to restore critical data and systems, such as financial or legal files, impacted by a security breach.

### Key Takeaways
- The NIST CSF provides structured guidance for security professionals to address cybersecurity risks effectively.
- Understanding these functions helps in creating robust security strategies and improving an organizationâ€™s overall security posture.
- Security incidents are inevitable; hence, organizations must be equipped to recover swiftly to minimize risks.

This structured approach through the NIST CSF enhances an organization's ability to protect sensitive data and respond to threats effectively.
