# Incident Response Playbooks

- **Definition**: A guide for security professionals to mitigate incidents with urgency and accuracy.
- **Purpose**:
  - Create structure for incident handling.
  - Ensure compliance and outline communication/documentation processes.
- **Types**: Specific playbooks may exist for various incidents, such as ransomware, malware, and DDoS attacks.
- **Importance**:
  - Provide a consistent process for security teams.
  - Are living documents that evolve based on new threats and past incidents.

### Use of Playbooks with SIEM Tools
- **SIEM Tools**: Used for threat detection by aggregating and analyzing security data.
- **Playbook Application**:
  - When a SIEM alerts unusual behavior (e.g., potential malware attack), the playbook guides the analyst through necessary actions.
  - Steps typically include:
    1. **Assess the Alert**: Validate the alert by analyzing log data and metrics.
    2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
    3. **Elimination**: Remove traces of the incident and restore systems using clean backups.
    4. **Post-Incident Activities**: Document the incident and communicate findings to stakeholders or authorities.

### Use of Playbooks with SOAR Tools
- **SOAR Tools**: Automate repetitive tasks related to threat monitoring and response.
- **Integration with Playbooks**:
  - SOAR tools handle automated responses (e.g., blocking an account after multiple failed login attempts).
  - Analysts then follow playbooks for further investigation and resolution steps.

### Key Takeaways
- Playbooks (or runbooks) are essential for structured incident response.
- They outline specific actions to reduce incident impact and protect critical assets.
- Continuous improvement of playbooks is vital to adapt to emerging threats and enhance organizational preparedness.

### Conclusion
- Understanding the role of playbooks, SIEM, and SOAR tools is crucial for entry-level security analysts to effectively monitor networks and respond to security incidents.
