# Navigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

### Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

1. **Assets**:
   - Items of value to an organization (e.g., physical spaces, computers, PII, intellectual property).

2. **Threats**:
   - Events that negatively impact assets (e.g., social engineering, phishing).

3. **Risks**:
   - Likelihood of a threat affecting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
   - Rated as low, medium, or high based on potential impact.

4. **Vulnerabilities**:
   - Weaknesses that can be exploited (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords).
   - Requires both a vulnerability and a threat to pose a risk.

### Common Types of Threats
- **Insider Threats**: Authorized users abusing access.
- **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Long-term unauthorized access.

### Risk Management Strategies
- **Acceptance**: Accepting risk without changes.
- **Avoidance**: Eliminating the risk entirely.
- **Transference**: Shifting risk to a third party.
- **Mitigation**: Reducing the impact of risks.

### NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) Steps
1. **Prepare**: Identify controls to reduce risks.
2. **Categorize**: Develop risk management processes.
3. **Select**: Choose and document protective controls.
4. **Implement**: Execute security and privacy plans.
5. **Assess**: Evaluate effectiveness of controls.
6. **Authorize**: Accountability for risks.
7. **Monitor**: Ongoing system awareness and risk assessment.

### Common Vulnerabilities
- **ProxyLogon**: Affects Microsoft Exchange server.
- **ZeroLogon**: Vulnerability in Netlogon authentication.
- **Log4Shell**: Allows remote code execution.
- **Server-side Request Forgery**: Manipulation of server applications.

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding threats, risks, and vulnerabilities is crucial for entry-level security analysts.
- Regular monitoring and updating systems is vital to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Frameworks like NIST RMF provide structured approaches for managing risks.
