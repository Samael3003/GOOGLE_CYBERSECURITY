# SIEM Tools Overview

1. **Types of SIEM Tools**:
   - **Self-hosted SIEM Tools**: Installed and maintained by an organization using its own infrastructure. Ideal for situations requiring physical control over confidential data.
   - **Cloud-hosted SIEM Tools**: Managed by SIEM providers and accessible via the internet, suitable for organizations not wanting to maintain their own infrastructure.
   - **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine self-hosted and cloud-hosted tools, leveraging cloud benefits while maintaining control over sensitive data.

2. **Examples of SIEM Tools**:
   - **Splunk**: Offers both self-hosted (Splunk Enterprise) and cloud-hosted (Splunk Cloud) options, useful for collecting and analyzing log data for security monitoring.
   - **Google's Chronicle**: A cloud-native SIEM tool focused on data analysis, log monitoring, and detection of threats, utilizing cloud capabilities for scalability and flexibility.

### Open-source vs. Proprietary Tools
- **Open-source Tools**: Free to use, community-driven, allowing customization and collaboration, leading to enhanced security. Examples include Linux and Suricata.
- **Proprietary Tools**: Developed by companies with usage fees; source code is not accessible to users, limiting customization and requiring payment for updates. Examples include Splunk and Chronicle.

### Common Myths in Cybersecurity
- You don’t need to be an expert coder or hacker to work in cybersecurity.
- A cybersecurity degree is not mandatory; diverse educational backgrounds can lead to successful careers in the field.
- Cybersecurity professionals often work collaboratively rather than in isolation.

### SIEM Dashboards
