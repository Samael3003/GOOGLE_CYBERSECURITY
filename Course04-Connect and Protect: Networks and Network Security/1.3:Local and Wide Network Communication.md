# Local and Wide Network Communication

### IP Addresses
- **Definition**: An IP address is a unique string that identifies a device's location on the internet.
- **Types**:
  - **IPv4**: Written as four 1-3 digit numbers separated by decimal points (e.g., 192.168.1.1). Supports up to 4.3 billion addresses.
  - **IPv6**: Composed of eight hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, allowing for 340 undecillion addresses (e.g., 2002:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff21:0023:1234).

### Address Types
- **Public IP Address**: Assigned by an ISP; visible on the internet, shared by devices on a local network.
- **Private IP Address**: Used for local network communication; not visible on the internet.

### MAC Address
- **Definition**: A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to physical devices on a network. Used by switches to direct data packets.

### Network Layer (OSI Model)
- **Layer 3 Operations**: Organizes addressing and delivery of data packets, directing them from the host to the destination IP address.
- **IP Packet Structure**:
  - **Header**: Contains routing information (source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.).
  - **Data**: Contains the message being transferred (e.g., website data, emails).

### IPv4 Packet Header Fields
1. **Version (VER)**: Indicates the protocol version (IPv4).
2. **IP Header Length (HLEN)**: Specifies the length of the header.
3. **Type of Service (ToS)**: Prioritization information for routers.
4. **Total Length**: Total size of the IP packet.
5. **Identification**: Unique identifier for packet fragments.
6. **Flags**: Fragmentation details.
7. **Fragmentation Offset**: Position of fragment in the original packet.
8. **Time to Live (TTL)**: Counter to prevent infinite forwarding.
9. **Protocol**: Indicates the data portion's protocol.
10. **Header Checksum**: Checks for header corruption.
11. **Source IP Address**: IP of the sending device.
12. **Destination IP Address**: IP of the receiving device.
13. **Options**: Additional options for routing.

### Differences Between IPv4 and IPv6
- **IPv4**:
  - Format: 4 decimal numbers (0-255).
  - Size: 4 bytes.
- **IPv6**:
  - Format: 8 hexadecimal numbers.
  - Size: 16 bytes.
  - Simpler header format, eliminates fragmentation fields present in IPv4.
  - Introduces a Flow Label field for special packet handling.

### Security Implications
- Analyzing packet fields can reveal security information about the source, destination, and protocol.
- Understanding IP data packets aids in making security decisions during packet inspection.
