# Network Security Overview

#### **1. Importance of Secure Networks**
- Networks are at constant risk from malicious attacks (e.g., malware, spoofing, packet sniffing).
- Cyber attacks can lead to significant damage, including loss of confidential information and reputational harm.
- Example: Home Depot breach (2014) compromised over 56 million credit/debit cards.

# 2. Types of Attacks
- **Network Interception Attacks**:
  - Involve capturing and inspecting network traffic (e.g., packet sniffing).
  - Can alter data in transit (e.g., changing bank transfer details).

- **Backdoor Attacks**:
  - Exploit weaknesses intentionally left by developers for troubleshooting.
  - Attackers can gain unauthorized access to install malware, perform DoS attacks, or steal data.

#### **3. Consequences of Network Attacks**
- **Financial Impact**:
  - Disruptions can lead to significant revenue loss and costly reparations (e.g., rebuilding infrastructure, legal fees).

- **Reputation Damage**:
  - Public knowledge of a breach can erode customer trust and lead to loss of business.

- **Public Safety Risks**:
  - Compromised government networks can threaten public welfare (e.g., access to power grids, water systems).

#### **4. Key Takeaways**
- Security analysts must stay informed about vulnerabilities and attack methods.
- Continuous education is vital to maintain network safety and mitigate potential threats.
