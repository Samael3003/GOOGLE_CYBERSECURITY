### Network Hardening
- Focuses on securing network-related aspects, including:
  - Port filtering
  - Network access privileges
  - Encryption
- Regular tasks include:
  - Firewall rules maintenance
  - Network log analysis (using SIEM tools)
  - Patch updates
  - Server backups
- One-time tasks include:
  - Port filtering on firewalls
  - Setting network access privileges
  - Implementing encryption

### Security Tools
1. **Firewall**: 
   - Blocks or allows traffic based on rules.
   - NGFWs can inspect packet payloads.

2. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**:
   - Monitors for possible intrusions and alerts administrators.
   - Can only detect known attacks; does not block traffic.

3. **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**:
   - Monitors for intrusions and takes action to stop them.
   - Inline system; may block legitimate traffic if misconfigured.

4. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**:
   - Collects and analyzes log data from various sources for monitoring.
   - Central dashboard for alerts but does not take action on its own.

### Key Considerations
- Layered security approach (defense in depth) enhances network protection.
- Each security device adds a layer of defense, with costs associated with implementation and maintenance.
- Organizations must balance security needs against budget and risk.
