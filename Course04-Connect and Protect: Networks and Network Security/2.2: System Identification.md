# System Identification

### Firewall Types and Functions
- **Types of Firewalls**:
  - **Hardware Firewall**: Inspects each data packet before allowing it into the network.
  - **Software Firewall**: Installed on computers/servers to analyze incoming traffic; typically costs less and doesn’t take up physical space, but may add processing burden.
  - **Cloud-Based Firewall**: Hosted by cloud service providers; configurable through their interface, protects cloud-based assets.

- **Firewall Operations**:
  - Monitors traffic and applies rules to allow or block it.
  - Uses port filtering to control communication on specific ports (e.g., allowing port 443 for HTTPS).

- **Stateful vs. Stateless Firewalls**:
  - **Stateful Firewalls**: Track information about ongoing connections; proactive threat filtering.
  - **Stateless Firewalls**: Operate on predefined rules without tracking; generally less secure.

- **Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)**: Provide advanced security functions like deep packet inspection and intrusion protection, often connected to threat intelligence services.

### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- **Functionality**: Masks public IP address and encrypts data to protect privacy when using public networks.
- **Encapsulation**: VPNs wrap sensitive data in additional packets to maintain privacy while allowing routers to direct traffic.
- **Encryption**: Provides a secure tunnel between device and VPN server, ensuring data confidentiality.

### Security Zones
- **Definition**: Segments of a network that enhance internal network security by controlling access.
- **Types of Security Zones**:
  - **Uncontrolled Zone**: Outside of organization’s control (e.g., the internet).
  - **Controlled Zone**: Subnets protecting internal networks; includes:
    - **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**: Hosts public-facing services, acts as a perimeter defense.
    - **Internal Network**: Contains private servers/data.
    - **Restricted Zone**: Protects highly confidential data; accessed only by privileged users.

### Subnetting and CIDR
- **Subnetting**: Divides a network into smaller logical groups (subnets) for efficiency and security.
- **CIDR**: Classless Inter-Domain Routing; allows flexible IP address allocation and subnet creation using a network prefix (e.g., 198.51.100.0/24).

- **Security Benefits**: 
  - Efficient use of bandwidth and improved network performance.
  - Creates isolated subnetworks that enhance security.

---

### Proxy Servers
- **Definition**: Servers that forward client requests to other servers, adding security layers.
- **Functionality**:
  - Hides internal IP addresses from the internet.
  - Blocks access to unsafe websites.
  - Caches frequently accessed data to reduce internal server contact.

- **Types of Proxy Servers**:
  - **Forward Proxy**: Manages outgoing traffic, hides user IP addresses.
  - **Reverse Proxy**: Controls incoming traffic to protect internal servers.
  - **Email Proxy**: Filters spam, mitigates phishing risks.

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding firewalls, VPNs, security zones, subnetting, and proxy servers is crucial for network security.
- Each component plays a vital role in protecting organizational networks from external threats and ensuring data privacy.

### Virtual Networks and Privacy

1. **Network Security Fundamentals**:
   - Protecting private networks involves maintaining data confidentiality and limiting access to authorized users.

2. **Common Network Protocols**:
   - **Categories**:
     - **Communication Protocols** (e.g., TCP, UDP, SMTP)
     - **Management Protocols** (e.g., ICMP for troubleshooting)
     - **Security Protocols** (e.g., IPSec, SSL/TLS for encryption)
   - **Common Protocols**:
     - HTTP, DNS, ARP.

3. **Wireless Security Protocols**:
   - **WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3**: WPA3 uses AES for encryption.

4. **Network Security Tools**:
   - **Firewalls**: Filter traffic; types include stateless and stateful. Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) include deep packet inspection and additional features like malware sandboxing.
   - **Proxy Servers**: Act as intermediaries for client requests, enhancing security through network address translation (NAT).
   - **VPNs**: Encrypt data and hide IP addresses, protecting privacy. They can be combined with SD-WAN for enhanced security across multiple locations.

### VPN Protocols

1. **Types of VPNs**:
   - **Remote Access VPNs**: Connect individual devices to a VPN server.
   - **Site-to-Site VPNs**: Connect entire networks, commonly using IPSec.

2. **VPN Protocols**:
   - **WireGuard**: High-speed, simpler setup, open-source, suitable for both site-to-site and client-server connections.
   - **IPSec**: Older, widely supported, complex but with a history of security testing.

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding network protocols and security tools is crucial for protecting network integrity.
- VPN protocols differ in complexity, speed, and use cases, with WireGuard offering potential performance benefits and IPSec being more established.
