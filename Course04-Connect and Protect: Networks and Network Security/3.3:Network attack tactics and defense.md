# Network attack tactics and defense

### Packet Sniffing
- **Definition**: Capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.
- **Uses**: Security analysts use it for troubleshooting and incident analysis, while malicious actors exploit it to access sensitive information.
- **Types**:
  - **Passive Sniffing**: Reading packets without altering them.
  - **Active Sniffing**: Manipulating packets, such as injecting protocols.

### Protection Against Packet Sniffing
- **VPNs**: Encrypt data to prevent unauthorized access.
- **HTTPS**: Ensures secure communication and protects data integrity.
- **Avoid Public WiFi**: Use a VPN on unprotected networks to safeguard data.

### IP Spoofing
- **Definition**: Changing the source IP of a packet to impersonate an authorized user.
- **Common Attacks**:
  - **On-Path Attacks**: Intercepting and altering communications between devices.
  - **Replay Attacks**: Resending captured packets to impersonate users.
  - **Smurf Attacks**: Flooding a target with packets using spoofed IP addresses.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Encryption**: Always encrypt data to protect against interception.
- **Firewalls**: Configure to reject packets with suspicious IP addresses.

### Key Takeaway
Implement a multi-layered defense strategy, utilizing encryption and firewalls, to effectively mitigate the risks of packet sniffing and IP spoofing attacks.
